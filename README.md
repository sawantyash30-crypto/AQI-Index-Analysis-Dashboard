# AQI Index Analysis Dashboard | Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive **AQI (Air Quality Index) Analysis Dashboard** built using **Power BI** to monitor air pollution levels across India.  
The dashboard enables state-level and city-level analysis of AQI, dominant pollutants, and air quality trends over time.

## 🎯 Business Objective
To help analysts, policymakers, and stakeholders:
- Identify pollution hotspots
- Understand dominant pollutants
- Track AQI trends over time
- Support data-driven environmental decision-making

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Power BI
- DAX
- Data Modeling
- Data Visualization

## 📊 Dashboard Features
- AQI analysis by **Year, State, and City**
- AQI categorization (Good → Hazardous)
- Identification of **primary pollutants** (PM10, PM2.5, etc.)
- City-wise AQI comparison to highlight high-risk areas
- Pollutant occurrence frequency analysis
- AQI trend analysis to observe seasonal patterns
- Interactive slicers for dynamic exploration

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Maharashtra recorded an average AQI of **101**, categorized as **Poor**
- **PM10** emerged as the most frequent and dominant pollutant
- Several cities consistently show higher AQI levels than the state average
- Majority of AQI readings fall under **Moderate** and **Poor** categories
- AQI trend analysis reveals noticeable seasonal variation
